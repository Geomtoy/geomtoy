## About coordinate system & positive rotation direction

`Screen Coordinate System`, a 2D coordinate system used in computer graphics, is a 2D left-handed coordinate system, hereinafter referred to as abbreviation `LHS`. The positive rotation direction is **clockwise**.

While `Plane Analytical Geometric Coordinate System`, a 2D coordinate system used in geometric mathematics, is a 2D right-handed coordinate system, hereinafter referred to as abbreviation `RHS`. The positive rotation direction is **anticlockwise**.

The angle generated under the positive rotation is called positive angle, and the value is a positive number. The opposite is the negative angle, and the value is a negative number. 

Why the positive rotation direction definition is not the same in `LHS` and `RHS`? Let's figure it out.

```javascript
// Let us assume that anticlockwise is the positive rotation direction of angles in both `LHS` and `RHS`.
// `angle` is generated by rotating the positive x-axis Math.PI / 2 anticlockwise.
let angle = Math.PI / 2
// `pointA` is lying on x-axis with coordinates of [1, 0], `pointB` holds the destination coordinates of `pointA`'s movement.
let pointA = [1, 0], 
    pointB = [undefined, undefined]
// `pointA` moves a distance of 2 forward along `angle`.
pointB[0] = pointA[0] + 2 * Math.cos(Math.PI / 2) // 1
pointB[1] = pointA[1] + 2 * Math.sin(Math.PI / 2) // 2
// `pointB` is [1, 2].

// Obviously, from the perspective of `RHS`, this result is correct,
// but from the perspective of `LHS`, the `pointA` moves upward, the `y` coordinate should become smaller, 
// and our expected result is [1, -2].

// If we change the angle from `Math.PI / 2` to `-Math.PI / 2`
pointB[0] = pointA[0] + 2 * Math.cos(-Math.PI / 2) // 1
pointB[1] = pointA[1] + 2 * Math.sin(-Math.PI / 2) // -2
// `pointB` is [1, -2].
// It meets our expectation. So our assumption above is wrong. Anticlockwise is the negative rotation direction in `LHS`,
// and clockwise is the the positive rotation direction in `LHS`
```

In fact, it is more accurate to say that ***the direction of rotation from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is the positive rotation direction***. For `LHS`, the direction of this kind of rotation happens to be clockwise, and for `RHS`, the direction of this kind of rotation happens to be anticlockwise.

So, when you deal with options of `Geomtoy` like:

```javascript
let g = new Geomtoy({
    // ... other options
    coordinateSystem:{
        xAxisPositiveOnRight: true,
        yAxisPositiveOnBottom: true,
        originX: 0,
        originY: 0,
        scale: 1
    }
})

g.setOptions({
    // ... other options
    coordinateSystem:{
        xAxisPositiveOnRight: true,
        yAxisPositiveOnBottom: false,
        originX: 0,
        originY: 0,
        scale: 1
    }
})
```
No matter `xAxisPositiveOnRight` and `yAxisPositiveOnBottom` are `true` or `false`, just remember the positive rotation direction is always from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis. And you can easily get these conclusions:
- When `xAxisPositiveOnRight !== yAxisPositiveOnBottom`, the coordinate system you setup is `RHS`
- When `xAxisPositiveOnRight === yAxisPositiveOnBottom`, the coordinate system you setup is `LHS`
